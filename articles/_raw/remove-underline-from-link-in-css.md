If you're a web developer, you've probably wanted to get rid of the default underline that appears when you add a link to a page.

<!-- more -->

Fortunately, just like other elements on a web page, you can style the anchor tags responsible for displaying a link.

In this article, I will show you how to remove the underline from a link with CSS. I will also show you the four states links can be in, and how to remove the underline for each one.

## How to Remove Underline from a Link in CSS

By default, this is how the link tag appears in the browser: ![ss1-4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/ss1-4.png)

Firstly, it is important to know that the link tag (anchor tag) can be in 4 different states called pseudo-classes:

-   `a:link`: the regular state of the link when it is not active, visited, or hovered on
-   `a:visited`: when the link has been clicked by the user, that is, visited
-   `a:hover`: when the user is hovering on the link
-   `a:active`: when the user is clicking on the link

**N.B.:** The states (pseudo-classes) must appear in the order listed above due to the cascading nature of CSS.

To finally **remove the default underline** of the link, you can target all the pseudo-classes and assign them a `text-decoration` property of `none`.

```
<p>This is a <a href="#">link</a></p>
```

```
 a:link {
      text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
      text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
      text-decoration: none;
}

a:active {
      text-decoration: none;
}
```

You can also remove the default underline all in one with the anchor element selector:

```
 a {
       text-decoration: none;
}
```

You can play with the 4 pseudo-classes of the link tag with this pen:

We just published a massive 25-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you master the fundamentals of operating systems. This course is designed to provide an academically oriented and comprehensive understanding of Operating Systems (OS), making it one of the most detailed OS courses available. Kshitij Sharma created this course.

## **Course Content**

Here are the key things you will learn in this course:

-   **Academically Oriented & Comprehensive Understanding**: Dive deep into the intricacies of Operating Systems with the most detailed course on this platform.
    
-   **Conceptual Clarity**: Solve numerous practice questions to ensure your concepts are crystal clear.
    
-   **Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills**: Learn to analyze and solve complex OS-related problems.
    
-   **Appreciation for Depth**: Explore a wide range of OS topics with meticulous attention to detail.
    

And here are the key sections in the course:

### **1\. Introduction and Background**

-   **Defining an OS**: Understand OS through multiple definitions, Von Neumann Architecture, and the significance of main memory.
    
-   **Types of OS**: Explore uni-programming, multiprogramming, and multitasking OS, along with their architectural requirements.
    
-   **User and Kernel Mode Shifting**: Learn about APIs, system calls, interrupts, and mode shifting perspectives.
    

### **2\. Process Management**
